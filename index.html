            Hello I am Mark, a transplant from the Midwest and enjoying the Pacific Northwest. <br>
            I am married and have two amazing kids (boy and a girl).  When I am not working and being a family man,<br>
            I am an all around outgoing geek kinda guy.  I enjoy finding new places to eat, food trucks especially. <br>
            Going to shows, movies, also getting out of the city and getting into nature when I can.  <br>
            At home I enjoy tv, movies and games (electroniic and board).  I enjoy teaching video game history to my kids, <br>
            as I am 36 and have lived in multiple eras of gaming. You could say I have a good passion for retro games. <br>
